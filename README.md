Lesson 1 


1) useState
we use useState to access and update a state in compoenent
when a value of useState changes it re-render the whole compoenent
2) props
we can pass the props in the compoenent as attributes or as childrens
3) events (onChange, onClick)

4) JSX
we need to return only one parent element inside the compoenent
